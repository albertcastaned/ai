The division problemsets will share many problems, but not all of them will be the same. So, Div. 1 users should register on "Codeforces Round #755 (Div. 1 Only)" while Div. 2 users should register on "Codeforces Round #755 (Div. 2 Only)". It starts on Sunday, November, 14, 2021 06:05 (UTC). The contest duration is 2 hours. The allowed programming languages are C/C++, Pascal, Java, C#, Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, Haskell, Scala, OCaml, Go, D, JavaScript and Kotlin. The rounds are rated.

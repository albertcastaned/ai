Summer is moving on in the Valley of Flowers.
The days of joy and carelessness are over.
The cruel winds are blowing from the North and with them comes the smoke of 
the fires burning and echoes of the armies marching. The last vestige of hope 
remains with those who survived the slaughter and fled the battlefield to fight 
another day. Their wounds will heal, but the sorrow will remain with them forever..., 
'Take part in the decisive battles between all factions raging all across 
The Continent and reap your rewards.
The Harvest time is upon us!
